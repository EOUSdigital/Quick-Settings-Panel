# 🌓 Theme Toggle Project (IIFE Pattern)

This small browser-based app demonstrates how to use an **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)** to encapsulate JavaScript logic and toggle between light and dark themes without exposing global variables.

## ✅ Features

- Theme toggle button using `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element
- Clean HTML structure and accessible markup
- Simple CSS for light and dark themes
- JavaScript logic fully contained inside an IIFE

## 💡 Learning Goals

- Practice using IIFE to isolate variables and functions
- Connect HTML buttons to JavaScript behavior using `data-` attributes
- Dynamically manipulate DOM attributes (`data-theme`)
- Keep JavaScript logic minimal, scoped, and functional

## 📁 Project Structure

```
index.html       # Contains markup and toggle button
style.css        # Defines light/dark theme styles based on data-theme attribute
script.js        # Contains IIFE logic for theme toggling
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Click the toggle button to switch between light and dark themes
3. Observe changes based on `data-theme` changes on the `<html>` tag

## 🧠 Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom data-attribute styling)
- JavaScript (ES6 arrow functions, IIFE, DOM interaction)

## ✨ Bonus Ideas

- Store the selected theme in localStorage
- Add animation between themes
- Expand with more settings (font size, contrast, etc.)
